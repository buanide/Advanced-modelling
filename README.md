# Advanced modeling

As part of our advanced modeling course, we've created a project to study customer satisfaction among scooter users.

## Project: Scooter users satisfaction.

File: scooter.xls

Several importance variables (score from 1 to 5) given by users to different characteristics of a scooter (store of origin, brand, etc.) are recorded as well as an overall satisfaction score (from 1 to 10).

## Objective 
- Find "typical" profiles of scooter users. 
- What's the difference between men and women? 
- What type of scooter would you suggest to a man/woman?

## Techniques used
 - Study of univariate and bivariate statistics as a function of the gender variable
 - Study of the correlation matrix
 - Creation of a PCA 

## Highlights 
 - Hierarchical clustering hcpc
    This test was not very conclusive, as the method failed to distinguish between two groups.
 - Performing MFA (multiple factor analysis)
    Since we have both quantitative and qualitative data, the afm method enables us to study all the data simultaneously. The results are more satisfactory than those obtained before.

## Results

First, whe have found out 4 groups in our database. We have seen similitudes between the 2 first group who are men who prefer innovative scooters that look like motorbike with big engines, and that are sober and low key. These men are either of the middle or the upper class. Next, the analysis allowed us to see that women prefer scooter with smaller engines and that are fashionable.
